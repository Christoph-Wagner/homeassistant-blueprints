blueprint:
  name: Turn off device after a certain time with little power draw
  description: This is a blueprint to turn off a smart plug after the power draw has been low for a certain time. It’s useful for devices that draw significant power in standby, like PCs.
  domain: automation
  input:
    power_sensor:
      name: Electric Power Sensor
      description: This sensor used to identify when the target device has been shut off.
      selector:
        entity:
          domain: sensor
    power_threshold:
      name: Power Threshold in Watts
      description: When the device is not used is should draw less power than the power threshold so that the automation kicks in when that action of the device has finished. It should be set above the standby power of the device and below the power when is actively used. For reliability set the value with headroom. For example in the range of 5 Watts more than the constantly used power and 5 Watts less than the power that indicates your device activity. The default value is set to 20 Watts.
      default: 20

      name: Target Smart Plug
      description: This smart plug will be turned off once the treshold is reached for the configured amount of minutes.
